# hackathon_chatbot (You.ai)

## Overview

We created a chatbot platform that recreates your personality based on your online social interactions. Not only do we study human interactions, but also provide a chatbot framework geared toward machine learning research.

## What

You.ai, a novel machine learning platform, allows you to create versatile and scalable chatbots that are compatible on a bunch of platforms. Tinder? Twilio? Done and done. Our chatbots will maintain your conversations for you.

## How

You.ai uses your Facebook Messenger corpus to learn about you. We train our TensorFlow ML model using this data for our word2vec and sequence2sequence algorithms. We use the IBM Watson API to implement tonal analysis and direct the flow of the conversation just as you would. We use the Tinder and Twilio APIs to set up bots to maintain your conversations on these platforms. We also use the Cycle.io API to manage our container services.
